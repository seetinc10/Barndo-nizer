# Barndo-nizer



**Barndo-nizer** is a simple web-based **Barndominium Floor Plan Generator** (often called "Barndo Floor Plan Generator"). It allows users to quickly create and visualize custom interior layouts for barndominiums by adjusting overall building dimensions and generating room arrangements.

A barndominium ("barndo") is a metal building that combines living quarters with workshop/garage space, popular for its affordability, durability, and open-concept design.

## Features

- Set custom building dimensions (length and width in feet and inches)
- Automatically generate a grid-based interior room layout
- View labeled room dimensions directly on the plan
- Generate new layouts with a single click
- Export the floor plan as PNG or PDF
- Clean, dark-themed UI for easy use
